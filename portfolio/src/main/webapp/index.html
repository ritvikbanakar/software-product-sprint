        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in India however, our family moved to California when I was in kindergarden. 
            Growing up in the Bay Area, technology was all around us so that innately struck a chord with my friends and I. 
            Starting with Scratch programming in 5th grade, a lifelong programming interest was sparked. Currently this spark has lead me to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to major in Computer Science.
            However, I also found a keen interest in things beyond the popular STEM teachings of the Bay Area.
            Irrespective of medium, I've found that I've always loved stories. I also realized that Computer Science is like a toolkit. It teaches you HOW to build but it's creativity that teaches you WHAT to build.
            My dream is to stop treating science and art so dicotomous and use CS as a bridge between them through unique interdisciplinary applications. </p>
